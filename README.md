# BG: Senior Capstone Project
BG is my senior capstone project. It's a interactive narrative video game.

The gametype is exploration and narrative. The player wakes up on an abandoned spacecraft with no memory of who they are. Though there are signs of former life on the ship, everything is deserted. It is the player's task to explore this ship and attempt to piece together who they are and what happened.

## Technical
I made BG with two other students. We used Unity and C# for the game development.
The original soundtrack was made using Logic Pro X and the voice actors were recorded using Logic Pro X as well. The appropriated sound effects are from freesound.org.
