# BG: Senior Capstone Project
BG is my senior capstone project. It's a interactive narrative video game.

The gametype is exploration and narrative. The player wakes up on an abandoned spacecraft with no memory of who they are. Though there are signs of former life on the ship, everything is deserted. It is the player's task to explore this ship and attempt to piece together who they are and what happened.

## Technical
I made BG with two other students. We used Unity and C# for the game development.
The original soundtrack was made using Logic Pro X and the voice actors were recorded using Logic Pro X as well. The appropriated sound effects are from freesound.org.
The physical assets are from the Unity Store or made using Rhino.

## Updated Goal
My plan with reviving my old project is to improve the game to the point that it is worthy of an itch.io page.
The steps of this project are as follows:
  1. removed copyrighted material and replace it with creative commons or original work
  2. improve the visuals and audio already present
  3. add more narrative points
